# Breast-Cancer-Detection
### (Classify benign and malignant cell using kNN, SVM and Random Forest algorithms)

This breast cancer databases was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg.

Here we are classifying two types of tumours (benign and malignant) using some classification algorithms of Machine Learning.

### Attribute Information:
Sample code number id number

Clump Thickness 1 - 10

Uniformity of Cell Size 1 - 10

Uniformity of Cell Shape 1 - 10

Marginal Adhesion 1 - 10

Single Epithelial Cell Size 1 - 10

Bare Nuclei 1 - 10

Bland Chromatin 1 - 10

Normal Nucleoli 1 - 10

Mitoses 1 - 10

Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)
